This project is a front-end clone of the Visual Studio Code homepage, built with HTML and CSS. It features a responsive navigation bar, announcement banner, hero section with download buttons, a showcase of supported programming languages, and a footer. The design is inspired by the official Visual Studio Code website and is intended for demo purposes only.
